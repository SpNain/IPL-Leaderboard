## Working üìù

- We provide a link of a page of `ESPN` website that contions summary of all matches.

- It gives output by creating a leaderboard.

- Leaderboard contains the following information for each IPL franchise: player name, runs scored, balls faced, and strike rate.

- The leaderboard is displayed in a table format, with the ability to sort and filter by various columns.

- The project combines the information of each player and presents it in a clear and easy-to-read format.

- The leaderboard can be updated in real-time as new matches are played and new data is added to the website.

- The project uses npm packages `fs`, `cheerio`, and `request` to scrape data from the ESPN website.

- The `request` package is used to make HTTP requests to the ESPN website, while `cheerio` is used to parse and manipulate the HTML data that is returned.

- The `fs` package is used to write the scraped data to a file for storage or further processing.
